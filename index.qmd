## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
data(mtcars)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=hp, y=mpg, color=cyl)) +geom_point(size=3)
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}

```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
